"""
Prim's algorithm (also known as Jarn√≠k's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a
weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex,
where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.

Time complexity:
O(V*V) for adjacency matrix
